  of your next webpage?! '
excerpt: An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem
  Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. We have so many things that we have to do
  better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem
  Ipsum your entire adult life. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder
  text.

Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.

I know words. I have the best words. I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament.

Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable.

That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.

Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it.
