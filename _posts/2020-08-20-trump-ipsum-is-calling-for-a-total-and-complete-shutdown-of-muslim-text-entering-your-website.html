excerpt: Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering
  your website. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text
  is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. I write the best placeholder
  text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and
  this is politics, are they really so different? My placeholder text, I think, is
  going to end up being very good with women.
