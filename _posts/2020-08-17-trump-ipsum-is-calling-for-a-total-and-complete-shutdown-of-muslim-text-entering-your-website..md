subtitle: " I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the
  web by far..."
excerpt: I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is
  that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. While that's mock-ups and
  this is politics, are they really so different? My placeholder text, I think, is
  going to end up being very good with women.

We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever.

I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text.

An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured.

If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text.
